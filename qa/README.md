# QA Engineer's test suites


This directory contains:

- server
- web

2 miniature projects, which can be up and running (web can connect to server). Both lacking test suites.

Your mission is to setup test suites for at least ONE of server/web projects, depending on your tech stack(Express/React Hooks), and submit your PR.

It's nice for us to have test suites for all the projects!
