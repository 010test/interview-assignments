# QA Engineer's test suites


This directory contains:

- server
- web
- mobile

3 miniature projects, which can be up and running (web/mobile can connect to server), but lacking test suites.

Your mission is to setup test suites for at least ONE of server/web/mobile projects, depending on your tech stack(Express/React Hooks/SwiftUI), and submit your PR.

It's nice to have test suites for all the projects(Coverage 3/3ðŸ˜„)!
